# jit-config

Just-in-time prompts for missing config.

If you are building a module or a starter project that needs config up front, you rely on documentation and errors to let
the developer know what config they need to add and where.  jit-config will remove that friction in a clever and convenient way.

* Define the config you need
* jit-config will look for it
* if it's not there, jit-config will prompt for it
* if it's production, jit-config will get out of the way
